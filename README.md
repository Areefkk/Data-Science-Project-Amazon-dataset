# Final-Year-Project
This repository contains all the code files and different datasets used during my final year Project.
This was a Data Science project focused on predicting customer review helpfulness. This was done by 
combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Text Analysis and Machine Learning methods to 
produce a holistic solution. 

The main focus was conducting predictive modelling by building Classification and Regression models and feeding 
our pre-processed data into these models to determine the most effective features 
(e.g. star rating, review length, readability, etc.) and the Machine Learning Algorithms with the best accuracy. 

In this project, I have performed Data Cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Splitting the data, building Machine Learning 
Models, and evaluating these models across different thresholds. I have also performed Data Visualisation in some instances.
